# Liri-PA
Meet Liri, your new personal assistant. Liri will assist you with maintaining your correspondence for your busy life so that you have more time to focus on all your other important tasks. She will manage your google calendar, for you by corresponding with the google calendar API, text you when it's time to leave for your event using the Google Maps and NEXMO APIs and text your friends to let them know that you are on the way. Since Liri is a google app, you will have to create a google account in order to meet your new PA.
